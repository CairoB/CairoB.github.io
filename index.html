            Falling refrigerator!<br>
            Refrigerator?<br>
        </p>
        <p>This is a poem I wrote when my age was a single digit. I don't know 
            why I still remember it, but it tells the tragic story of a fallen 
            food preservation device.</p>

        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>My absolute favorite hobby is video games. That's what got me into 
            computers as a kid and it's what inspires me to build, design, and 
            create. I play PC games of all kinds; single-player, multi-player, 
            sandbox, competitive, top-down, third-person... I'll play anything!</p>
        <p>I also enjoy tabletop RPGs. The most famous is Dungeons and Dragons 
            of course, but I play other ones, too. A group of friends and I 
            actually have a prototype system of our own, complete with combat 
            mechanics, items, statistics, and a complete world of lore.</p>
        <p>I play the guitar, bass, and piano. When I started with music my 
            parents wanted me to play the piano, but I convinced them to get 
            me a guitar instead. I've been playing for 11 years, more than 
            half of my entire life. It turned out I got into the piano after 
            learning in-depth music theory, so I guess my parents got their 
            way after all!</p>
